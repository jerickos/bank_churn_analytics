Bank Customer Churn Analytics Dashboard
Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn for a synthetic retail banking dataset (10,000 customers). The goal is to understand why customers leave, identify high‑risk segments, and highlight high‑value customers at risk. I built a four‑page Power BI dashboard supported by SQL and Python preprocessing to deliver clear, actionable insights for business stakeholders.

Objectives
•	Identify key drivers of customer churn
•	Segment customers by demographics, products, and behavior
•	Analyze product usage patterns and high risk combinations
•	Highlight high value customers who churned
•	Provide business recommendations to reduce churn
Dataset
Bank Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)
A synthetic dataset of 10,000 retail banking customers used for churn modeling and segmentation.

Key Insights
• 	Customers with low credit scores, short tenure, and 3–4 products churn the most
• 	Several high‑value customers (balances > $100k) still churned
• 	Certain product combinations are high‑risk
• 	Churn patterns vary by region and gender
• 	Early‑stage customers (0–2 years) are the most vulnerable


Recommendations
• 	Improve onboarding for new customers
• 	Reevaluate product bundles for customers with 3–4 products
• 	Prioritize high‑value churners for retention outreach
• 	Target regions with elevated churn
• 	Monitor high‑risk product combinations
